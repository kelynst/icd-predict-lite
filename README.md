# ðŸ©º ICD Predict Lite

A simplified project exploring how to predict ICD codes (medical billing codes) from clinical notes using Python.  
This repo is meant as a **learning + demo project** for automation and healthcare data workflows.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Goal** â†’ Explore how free-text clinical notes can be connected to ICD codes  
- **Approach** â†’ Work with preprocessing, text handling, and basic machine learning  
- **Status** â†’ Early-stage experiment ("Lite" version â€“ not a production model)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. *Clone the repository*
Clone this repo from GitHub onto your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelynst/icd-predict-lite.git
cd icd-predict-lite
```

### 2. *Create a virtual environment*
Set up an isolated Python environment for dependencies.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### 3. *Activate the virtual environment*
Enable the environment so Python and pip use the local versions.

- **macOS/Linux**
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell)**
  ```powershell
  .venv\Scripts\Activate
  ```

### 4. *Upgrade pip*
Make sure pip is up to date.
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 5. *Install dependencies*
Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. *Launch Jupyter Notebook*
   Start Jupyter inside the virtual environment to explore the notebooks.  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
